# EOHDto3D
The HD Remaster of the Etrian Odyssey games for DS came with brand new portraits for several classes.

This mod adds those portraits to Etrian Odyssey Untold 2, the 3DS remake of Etrian Odyssey II by editing over the extra DLC portraits.

REQUIREMENTS:

- Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold 's "Yggdrasil Veteran" DLC Portrait Pack

(Otherwise only the Beast's new portrait will show.)

CHANGE LOG:

- Replaced the DLC sprite in the last portrait slot of the following classes: LANDSKNECHT, PROTECTOR, DARK HUNTER, MEDIC, ALCHEMIST, TROUBADOUR, RONIN, HEXER, GUNNER, WAR MAGUS, and SOVEREIGN

- Replaced the 2nd to last Portrait for the SURVIVALIST class because that one was uglier.

- Replaced the "Panda Bear" recolor of the BEAST class with the new portrait because that class has no DLC portraits.

(They're 4 different animals now at least.)
